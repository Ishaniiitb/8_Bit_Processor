# 8-Bit Processor Project

This project is a complete design and implementation of an **8-bit processor**, built using fundamental digital logic components. It includes custom modules for the ALU, control unit, registers, clock generation circuits, and RAM. The processor is modeled at the circuit level and is suitable for simulation, demonstration, or educational use in computer architecture.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Program Counter, Instruction Register, and Memory Address Register
- RAM-based instruction and data storage
- Modular clock generation (astable, monostable, and final clock designs)
- Control logic for instruction decoding and signal routing

## 📚 Documentation

- **Overview.pdf**: Quick overview of the project components, design decisions, and usage.
- **THE 8-BIT PROCESSOR REPORT.pdf**: In-depth technical documentation including circuit logic, timing, and control design.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Digital circuit design and simulation software (e.g., Logisim, Multisim, or custom tools)
- Logic gates, flip-flops, memory blocks
- Clock circuits (Astable & Monostable multivibrators)

## 🚀 Getting Started

This is a hardware-level design project. To experiment with the processor:

1. Open the diagrams in a digital circuit simulation tool.
2. Reconstruct the circuits using logic gates and components.
3. Run the simulation step-by-step using the clock modules.
4. Use the RAM to load instructions and observe how the control unit manages execution.
